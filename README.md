# Gatsby's GraphCMS plugin testing

1. `git clone git@github.com:hmeissner/gatsby-graphcms-testing.git gatsby-graphcms-testing`
2. `cd gatsby-graphcms-testing/plugins/gatsby-source-graphcms && yarn && yarn build`
3. `cd ../.. && yarn && yarn develop`

Swap `yarn build` for `yarn watch` in plugin's directory for auto-rebuilding the plugin after you make changes to it.
### Every time you rebuild the plugin, gatsby's development server has to be restarted for the changes to reflect.
